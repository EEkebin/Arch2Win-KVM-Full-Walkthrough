# Arch2Win-KVM

**A full walkthrough of the commands and steps required to take to get Windows KVM installed for a Single GPU with GPU Patching.**
> This is to help out a lay person on getting their feet wet with Arch Linux and KVM technology. Although, I really recommend to start off with a simpler Operating System.

1. Download the latest Arch Linux .iso using your preferred method from the link below.
    https://archlinux.org/download/
2. Use Rufus to flash the .iso onto a USB (preferably 8 GB to 32 GB for seamless FAT32 formatting).
3. Use the following command to install Arch Linux.

```bash
archinstall
```

4. Please read and follow each step making sure to choose the options that pertain to your region, locale, and the drive to install the OS.
5. When choosing a bootloader, the best ones are GRUB and systemd-boot. If you are more comfortable getting your hands dirty for a little less overhead and lightweightedness, please use systemd-boot, however, either will work (hopefully)
6. I recommend choosing a Desktop installation with the Desktop Environment being KDE Plasma or something your familiar with already.
7. Please use pulseaudio.
8. After Installation, arch-chroot into the system.
9. Create a swapfile if wanted (recommended). The count argument is how much in MegaBytes. Please replace '16384' with your preferred amount.
> Think of a swapfile as a spot for hibernated apps, temporary or unused data to be stored in instead of being killed and lost when you run out of memory.

```bash
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=16384 status=progress
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
```
10. Add the swapfile to the fstab.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
```txt
/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0
```

11. Install and enable recommended packages.
```bash
sudo pacman -S bash-completion
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel libappindicator-gtk3 nano
sudo systemctl enable fstrim.timer
sudo systemctl enable sshd
```

## If you are using systemd-boot:
12. Edit `/boot/loader/entries/arch.conf` to make sure all of the intel_iommu, iommu, video stuff is inputted correctly before quiet splash.
```bash
sudo nano /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
```
```txt
options root=UUID=0a3407de-014b-458b-b5c1-848e92a327a3 rw intel_iommu=on iommu=pt iommu=1 intel_iommu=igfx_off video=efifb:off quiet splash
```

## If you are using Grub:
12. Edit `/etc/default/grub` to make sure the grub commands look identical or similar enough to your needs.
```txt
GRUB_DEFAULT=0
GRUB_TIMEOUT=0
GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0
GRUB_FORCE_HIDDEN_MENU="true"
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR="Arch Linux"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="intel_iommu=on iommu=pt iommu=1 intel_iommu=igfx_off video=efifb:off quiet splash"
```
Run the following command to update grub.
```bash
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

13. Comment out the following line in `/etc/pulse/default.pa`
```bash
sudo nano /etc/pulse/default.pa
```
```txt
load-module module-suspend-on-idle
```

14. Uncomment the following lines in `/etc/pacman.conf`
```bash
sudo nano /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```
```txt
[Multilib]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

15. Enable set-ntp.
```bash
sudo timedatectl set-ntp true
```

16. Install your preferred or the recommended desktop apps and packages. Here's a couple of my favourites that are good.
```bash
sudo pacman -S bashtop neofetch filezilla okteta zip unzip spectacle ark ntfs-3g qbittorrent kalgebra discord steam celluloid
```

17. Install yay.
```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-git.git
cd yay-git
makepkg -si
```

18. Install your favourite webbrowser. Mine is Brave.
```bash
yay -S brave-bin
```

## You can stop at this point if you don't want VFIO, GPU Patching, Windows KVM, or any other advanced features.

19. If you are using an audio jack that is NOT connected to a separate audio device (USB or PCIe sound card) then you will need to install the following package to use scream network audio instead.
```bash
yay -S scream
```

20. Install nvflash.
```bash
yay -S nvflash
```

21. Launch your browser once or twice to make sure everything is working.
22. Disable KWallet and other unnecessary things in `/.config/kwalletrc`
```bash
sudo nano /.config/kwalletrc
```
Add in the following:
```txt
[Wallet]
First Use=false
Enabled=false
```

23. Create a directory for your vgabios.
```bash
sudo mkdir /usr/share/vgabios
```

24. Download the forked and slightly modified version of NVIDIA-vBIOS-VFIO-Patcher from my GitHub through the following commands.
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EEkebin/NVIDIA-vBIOS-VFIO-Patcher/master/vbios_patcher.py
sudo chmod +x vbios_patcher.py
```

> I REALLY RECOMMEND YOU DO THIS NEXT BIT VIA SSH FROM A REMOTE MACHINE OR PHONE OR SOMETHING ELSE OTHER THAN THIS PC BECAUSE THE SCREEN WILL BE GOING BLANK WITH THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS.

25. Run the following commands to dump and patch the vbios.
```bash
sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target
sudo rmmod nvidia_drm nvidia_modeset nvidia
sudo nvflash --save oldrom.rom
```

26. Reboot.
```bash
sudo reboot
```

27. Once booted back up, run the following commands to place it in the correct directory and give it the proper permissions.
```bash
sudo mv oldrom.rom /usr/share/vgabios/
sudo chmod +x /usr/share/vgabios/oldrom.rom
```
28. Delete old temporary files.

29. Install required packages for KVM.
```bash
sudo pacman -S qemu libvirt edk2-ovmf virt-manager dnsmasq ebtables
sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd
sudo virsh net-start default
sudo virsh net-autostart default
sudo usermod -aG kvm,input,libvirt $(whoami)
```
30. Download the win-virtio drivers
```bash
wget https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/virtio-win.iso
```
