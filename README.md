# Arch2Win-KVM

**A full walkthrough of the commands and steps required to take to get Windows KVM installed for a Single GPU with GPU Patching.**
> This is to help out a lay person on getting their feet wet with Arch Linux and KVM technology. Although, I really recommend to start off with a simpler Operating System.

1. Download the latest Arch Linux .iso using your preferred method from the link below.
    https://archlinux.org/download/
2. Use Rufus to flash the .iso onto a USB (preferably 8 GB to 32 GB for seamless FAT32 formatting).
3. Use the following command to install Arch Linux.

```bash
archinstall
```

4. Please read and follow each step making sure to choose the options that pertain to your region, locale, and the drive to install the OS.
5. When choosing a bootloader, the best ones are GRUB and systemd-boot. If you are more comfortable getting your hands dirty for a little less overhead and lightweightedness, please use systemd-boot, however, either will work (hopefully)
6. I recommend choosing a Desktop installation with the Desktop Environment being KDE Plasma or something your familiar with already.
7. Please use pulseaudio.
8. After Installation, arch-chroot into the system.
9. Create a swapfile if wanted (recommended). The count argument is how much in MegaBytes. Please replace '16384' with your preferred amount.
> Think of a swapfile as a spot for hibernated apps, temporary or unused data to be stored in instead of being killed and lost when you run out of memory.

```bash
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=16384 status=progress
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
```
10. Add the swapfile to the fstab.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
```txt
/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0
```

11. Install and enable recommended packages.
```bash
sudo pacman -S bash-completion
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel libappindicator-gtk3 nano
sudo systemctl enable fstrim.timer
sudo systemctl enable sshd
```

## If you are using systemd-boot:
12. Edit `/boot/loader/entries/arch.conf` to make sure all of the intel_iommu, iommu, video stuff is inputted correctly before quiet splash.
```bash
sudo nano /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
```
```txt
options root=UUID=0a3407de-014b-458b-b5c1-848e92a327a3 rw intel_iommu=on iommu=pt iommu=1 intel_iommu=igfx_off video=efifb:off quiet splash
```

## If you are using Grub:
12. Edit `/etc/default/grub` to make sure the grub commands look identical or similar enough to your needs.
```txt
GRUB_DEFAULT=0
GRUB_TIMEOUT=0
GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0
GRUB_FORCE_HIDDEN_MENU="true"
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR="Arch Linux"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="intel_iommu=on iommu=pt iommu=1 intel_iommu=igfx_off video=efifb:off quiet splash"
```
Run the following command to update grub.
```bash
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

13. Comment out the following line in `/etc/pulse/default.pa`
```bash
sudo nano /etc/pulse/default.pa
```
```txt
load-module module-suspend-on-idle
```

14. Uncomment the following lines in `/etc/pacman.conf`
```bash
sudo nano /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```
```txt
[Multilib]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

15. Enable set-ntp.
```bash
sudo timedatectl set-ntp true
```

16. Install your preferred or the recommended desktop apps and packages. Here's a couple of my favourites that are good.
```bash
sudo pacman -S bashtop neofetch filezilla okteta zip unzip spectacle ark ntfs-3g qbittorrent kalgebra discord steam celluloid
```

17. Install yay.
```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-git.git
cd yay-git
makepkg -si
yay -S nvflash
```

18. If you are using an audio jack that is NOT connected to a separate audio device (USB or PCIe sound card) then you will need to install the following package to use scream network audio instead.
```bash
yay -S scream
```

19. Install your favourite webbrowser. Mine is Brave.
```bash
yay -S brave-bin
```

20. Launch your browser once or twice to make sure everything is working.
21. Disable KWallet and other unnecessary things in `/.config/kwalletrc`
```bash
sudo nano /.config/kwalletrc
```
Add in the following:
```txt
[Wallet]
First Use=false
Enabled=false
```
